# Deep Learning Nanodegree

This is a forked repository from [udacity's deeplearning repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch). It contains my completed implementation of the courses projects, related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). The projects involve implementing models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs to solve various tasks, from classifying dog breeds to generating text.

### Projects

* [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-bikesharing): Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.
* [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-dog-classification): Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.
* [TV Script Generation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-tv-script-generation): Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.
* [Face Generation](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/tree/master/project-face-generation): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.
