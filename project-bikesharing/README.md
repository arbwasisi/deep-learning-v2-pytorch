First project for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree.

In this project we are tasked with building a neural network to predict riders daily 
rental patterns for a bike ridership app. We build a neural network from scratch
and train it to learn bike rental patterns across a two year period to predict future
rental behavior from riders.
